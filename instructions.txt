Part 0 
    Open terminal and change the current directory to '...\\react-amplify-app'

Part 1
    First check the version of node and npm through the following commands on terminal:
        'node -v'  
        'npm -v'

    If either 'node' or 'npm' is not recognised the device needs to install nodejs through the following link "https://nodejs.org/en/download"

Part 2

    It is likely that 'react-script' dependency must be added manually if nodejs was never installed on your device. If this is the case, use the following command on terminal:
        'npm install react-scripts --save'

Part 3

    Run the Application with the following command on terminal:
        'npm start'
